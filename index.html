            <p>The name's Tracy. I'm a 24-year-old Kenyan design student with a tech sort of background and a lot to say about the trends and direction of the contemporary design
                world.</p>
            <p>I wanted to be an engineer for most of my life. By the time I changed my mind about that, my liaison with the applied sciences had drastically altered my worldview already. This still informs much of my work and work ethic - design is no less
                of a science in my eyes than physics or computing. (In other words, I like design as long as I can be a nerd about it.)</p>

        <div class="subtext coll">
            A good grasp of object-oriented programming and computing-related math as a whole. Proficient in CSS3 and HTML5; making significant inroads into JavaScript and python. Adobe Illustrator is both enjoyable for me and putty in my hands. <i>Putty.</i>            In addition to my knowledge of coding, I also speak five human languages and am in the process of learning a few more.
